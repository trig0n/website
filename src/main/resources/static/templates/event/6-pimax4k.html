        piplay works without any problems with the exception for pi_server.exe<br>
        pi_server.exe crashes sometimes, especially when the device isn't connected or gets disconnected<br>
        the correct nvidia driver actually make a difference (fixes bluescreens / low frame rate)<br>
        render quality found in piplay actually affects the image quality, but apparently does not affect the frame rate<br>
        supplied usb cable for head sensor is too long. tried another cable of the same length didn't work either (usb
        3.0 / 5V, 2A)<br>
        3m usb cable is good enough<br>
        hdmi cable is not removable/exchangeable
